# What is PyAct?
PyAct is an open-source package for python, meant to give the developers an easy way to develop games in 2d pixel-art.

# So, how it'll work?
basically, everything in the game is called sprite, except solid things, they called blocks.
every object has 6 features:
1. window - the window were this obj will appears and do his functionality.
2. x - the location in the x axis of the window (in the screen with the case of window).
3. y - the location in the y axis of the window (in the screen with the case of window).
4. width - the width of this object.
5. height - the height of this object.
6. texture - how the object will look.
